How to:

3) Enjoy!

Django-IDE helps you to:

    Easily create Django projects.
    Manage and edit existing project
    Edit and Save your code, with a editor based on Ace.
    Run and debug.

We'll assume you have Django installed already.


Django-IDE runs on a bottle server and uses Ace as the main code editor.
